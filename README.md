# Infer Typescript

This is the repo that contains the code behind my talk of the same name.

## Misc Notes

- Im not going to deal with ecosystem around typescript like build tools editors etc
- Im focusing on the type system with this talk and how you can express things succinctly and in a typesafe way
- Im not trying to convince you to use typescript, I just think its pretty neat some of things you can do with TS these days
- TS is turing complete so technically anything is possbible: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833
- I am not a language design expert
- I dont know if this is going to work or not but occasionally im going to ask a question just shout out what you think the answer is going to be
- Not going to cover every aspect of TS in this talk, mostly the things I have come across on my daily travels and the things I have found interesting
- Some cool advanced types here: https://github.com/andnp/SimplyTyped
